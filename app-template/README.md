## Created with Capacitor Create

This app was created using the `npx @lambda-capacitor/cli create` command, and comes with a very
minimal shell for building an app.

Note: unless you know what you're doing, we don't recommend using the `create` way of building an app. Instead, you'll
likely want to create an app using your framework's tooling (such as `create-react-app`), and then _add_ capacitor
to _that_ project (using `npx @lambda-capacitor/cli init`).

### Running this example

To run the provided example, can use serve command:

```bash
npx cap serve
```
